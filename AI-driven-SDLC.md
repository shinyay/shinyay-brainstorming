# Signals that an AI-driven SDLC is on the horizon

- Agent performance leaps – SWE-agent already edits entire repos and passes 12 × more benchmark tasks than non-interactive LLMs in a single year

- Gartner “Agentic AI” top trend for 2025 predicts early-production, fully autonomous pipelines within 18-24 months [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-tireless-teammate-how-agentic-ai-is-reshaping-development-teams)

# | Paper / Report | Key finding you can quote | Why it supports an AI-driven SDLC | Year
1 | AutoDev: Automated AI-Driven Development arXiv | Presents a framework where autonomous agents plan tasks, edit files, run builds, tests, and Git operations end-to-end. | Proof of a working multi-agent pipeline prototype. | 2024
2 | Agentless: Demystifying LLM-Based SE Agents arXiv | A “controller-free” agent matched SWE-Bench-Lite’s top score while being simpler and faster. | Shows that self-contained agents can already fix real GitHub issues. | 2024
3 | SWE-Bench+ Benchmark arXiv | Extends SWE-Bench to 2,294 harder tasks and tracks agent progress. | Benchmark trajectory indicates agents rapidly closing on human-level repo fixes. | 2024
4 | AutoGen (Microsoft) multi-agent framework arXiv | Demonstrates planner, coder, and critic agents co-writing code with reflection loops. | Supplies the orchestration pattern your “Reconcile” loop needs. | 2025
5 | APIGen-MT: Agentic Pipeline for Multi-Turn Data Generation arXiv | Uses committee-of-agents + feedback loops to generate verifiable datasets. | Shows agents can self-verify outputs—analogous to self-testing code. | 2025
6 | AI’s Impact on Traditional SDLC arXiv | Predicts autonomous CI/CD with minimal human touch, flags governance risks. | Gives a macro SDLC forecast you can cite for “2026–27 adoption.” | 2025
7 | Gartner: “AI Agents Transforming Software Engineering” Gartner | Calls agentic AI “autopilot for dev & testing”; early prod use in < 24 months. | Analyst endorsement—good for exec audiences. | 2025
8 | PwC Agent OS launch (Business Insider) Business Insider | Platform stitches multiple AI agents into a coordinated “armada.” | Shows enterprises investing in real multi-agent orchestration. | 2025
9 | Wired feature: “The AI-Powered Future of Coding Is Near” WIRED | Highlights SWE-agent debugging whole repos, Amazon Q translating codebases. | Mainstream press validation of autonomous coding trend. | 2024
